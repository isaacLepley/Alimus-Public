# Intersecting the Truths

## Cosmos and Location

Alimus is a unique location not only in the world, but in the multiverse. The crystals atop Mount Fyr and their interaction with various phenomena make Alimus a place of particular interest for pilgrims and scholars. Visitors from other continents, planes, and even Wildspace add to the diversity and intrigue of Alimus.

## Cosmos and Organization

Alimus’s government - most especially the constables - constantly work with invested parties to ensure celebrations throughout the city are safe, logistically sound, and follow regulations.

## Cosmos and Religion

Temples to every god throughout Alimus have claimed various astronomical phenomena as signs and festivals for their god. The grand temple of Selune has two massive physical models of the stars and planets set into the temple floor, and these set the standard for the astrological calendar in the city.

## Cosmos and the Crystals

When astrological phenomena occur (like a meteor shower lighting up the sky, or an alignment of celestial bodies), the crystals will typically shimmer or glow as the crystals purportedly amplify the energies of the cosmos. This astrological energy manifests as phenomena throughout the city, e.g. glowing lights floating above the ground, particular creatures like a bird species swarming the city, or flowers suddenly blooming in every livable nook and cranny.

## Location and Organization

Alimus is a tiered city. The various tiers are physically separated from each other by walls and gradually ascend up the foothills toward Mount Fyr. From the farming hamlets on the plains to the grand estates in Upper Echelon, Alimus is generally wealthier and safer the higher in the city you are.

## Location and Religion

Every religion with a temple in Alimus has a rich history tied to the land. Every religion has stories of how their god was influential in particular advancements, wars, and events throughout the known history of the city. Like the crystals, there is record of religion in Alimus since ancient, prehistoric times.

## Location and the Crystals

The crystals seem to provide protection from extreme weather, so the area around Alimus is very fruitful and desirable to settle. 

## Organization and Religion

Religion is interwoven with the organization of Alimus. The six seats on the city government represent a faithful body that oversees an important aspect of running the city. Priestly mandates from those religions are effectively law, and many petitioners have a hard time arguing for change in the city when their viewpoint doesn’t align with that of a powerful church.

## Organization and the Crystals

The crystals are overseen by an ancient monastery that reveres the crystals and their unique energies. This monastery is outside the city, but these reclusive monks are well respected, and it is not uncommon for the city government to consult the monks on various matters.

## Religion and the Crystals

As religion in Alimus is deeply tied to the land, every group has old stories about the connection between their god and the iconic crystals atop Mount Fyr. Many religions highly revere these crystals and view them as a connection between the material world and the divine. However, some religions disdain the crystals. 

For example, faithful to Umberlee or Typhon may sneer at the crystals and their effect on the weather, since tumultuous, stormy seas represent their god’s will in the world. To their displeasure, the crystals’ calming effect on weather makes rough waves and coastal storms never affect Alimus and the sailors in its port.
