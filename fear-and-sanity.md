# Fear and Sanity

This game will feature horror as a prominent theme, and will include mechanics to represent fear and mental stress, as outlined below. These mechanics exist to facilitate players roleplaying their characters' accurate response to horrific things they will come across in the game. Fear and horror cannot work without player buy-in, however, and players are encouraged to play into their characters' fears and reactions to the horrors they face. To encourage this roleplay, one **inspiration** will be handed out at the end of each session to a player who portrayed their character well.

## Phobias

In Alimus, everyone has up to three **phobias** that represent their greatest fears. When a creature encounters one of their phobias, they must succeed a DC 15 **sanity check** or become frightened. New characters will begin the game with the following phobias:
- One creature phobia
- One creature or general phobia
- One specific phobia
The following lists are suggested phobias for this campaign. Players may pick a different, fitting phobia for any category with DM approval.
### Creature Phobias:

- Aberrations
- Beasts
- Celestials
- Constructs
- Dragons
- Elementals
- Fey
- Monstrosities
- Plants
- Undead
### General Phobias:

- Claustrophobia: having difficulty moving, being trapped or in tight quarters
- Humanoid fears:
	- Criminals
	- A class of people (sailors, salespeople, farmers, etc.)
	- Police figures
	- Religious figures
- Environment fears:
	- A particular district of Alimus
	- Being underground
	- Being underwater
	- Religious buildings
	- Government buildings

## Fear

> Frightened. 
> 	 - A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls.

## Sanity Checks

A sanity check is a mental ability check rolled when a creature is exposed to fear, horror, or is at risk of gaining stress. Being ability checks, characters do not apply proficiency to any sanity roll. Because characters can deal with trauma differently, players may choose to use any mental ability for a sanity roll, based on their method of handling the trauma they experience:

Rationalize (Intelligence): a character can roll intelligence to deal with trauma as they rationalize the horror. For example, they could see a mangled corpse and tell themselves that the person passed quickly, and the horrific sight of the corpse doesnâ€™t represent what the dead person experienced in their final moments.
Compartmentalize (Wisdom): a character can deal with trauma by ignoring the most horrific aspects of their fear, either visualizing something less horrible or simply ignoring the truly terrible facets of what they face.
Courage (Charisma): A character can brave up and put on a face of courage and defiance in the face of fear, and sometimes that is enough to be able to deal with fear in the moment.

## Stress

A character exposed to 
Stress can manifest in many ways, and players will not know the specifics of any stress until they are affected by stress or accurately identify the stress plaguing a creature they interact with. Below is an example stress:


> **Paranoia**.  You worry about hidden threats, making you anxious. You have disadvantage on all mental ability checks as you become jittery, but gain advantage on Perception checks.

## Hope

Despite all the terrors that threaten the residents of Alimus, hope and happiness exist in abundance as well. Characters have various **favorites** that will give them particular benefits depending on its type.

Favored Enemy
