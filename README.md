# Player Overview:


## Hook:

In the sprawling megacity of Alimus, the "stairway to the heavens," opportunities for adventure and greatness abound. Where temples to the gods above stand, cults of evil lurk in the shadows. While powerful figures strive to better the city, corruption festers and others seek control for their own gain.

Alimus needs adventurers like you to fight for good and challenge the status quo. Help is always within reach, whether through temples, dojos, guilds, or conclaves. Claim your destiny and remember, in Alimus, the world is your oyster.

## Five Truths:

- Cosmos: The cosmos is very active, and astrological events coincide with all sorts of festivals and phenomena every year.
- Location: Alimus is positioned in the foothills of Mount Fyr, surrounded by three distinct biomes: plains, woods, and sea.
- Organization: The city is split up into several major districts that generally proceed upwards towards the mountain. Some are lower and very accessible, while some are higher towards the mountain and less accessible to the masses.
- Religion: The city is very religious, and the influence of gods is real. Their touch is seen and felt throughout the city.
- The Crystals: The crystals at the peak of Mount Fyr are ancient and mysterious. The crystals are said to protect the surrounding area from things like bad weather and even assaults on the city.
