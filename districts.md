# City Districts

## Upper Tier

### High Terrace
High Terrace is the only part of upper Alimus open to the public. It contains dozens of temples to the high gods - including those to Selûne, Oghma, Bane, and Tyr. Among the notable great temples not in High Terrace is the temple to Bahamut, which towers over Cold Town. It is said to be located there because the silver dragon that takes care of the temple prefers the cold environment.
### Upper Echelon

Upper Echelon is where the wealthiest citizens of Alimus reside - and is where the high government presides. It sits behind the highest walls and has many gated sections within. 
The only truly open part of Upper Echelon is the temple square, where massive cathedrals to the most powerful gods look over the city below.

## Middle Tier

### Alimus Proper

The largest and central district of Alimus, situated between Main Port and the Woods. Visitors by land often enter the city through the main gate, which cuts between the lesser districts of Low Town and Cold Town and leads into Alimus Proper. This district is exceptionally diverse and could be a small city itself - full of homes, markets, temples, taverns, and just about anything else.

### The Woods

The woods is a beautiful district situated on the foothills neighboring the vast Desmaden forest. An airy and vibrant district, it is where many of Alimus’s woodsy creatures call home. Here is where you will find the temples to gods of nature and wilderness, religions followed by a large number of faithful, even in a large city like Alimus.

## Lower Tier
### Cold Town

Cold Town is a chilly part of Alimus where it is always cold and there are always snowflakes falling from the sky, even on a clear day.

### Low Town

Situated between the Lower Port and the main city gates, low town is slummy, crummy, and often dangerous. The constables avoid Low Town, and it is full of all sorts of characters, the only common trait among them perhaps being that they are resilient, if nothing else.

### Farming Hamlets

Small settlements outside the city walls still enjoy the calm weather of Alimus. Various farms that support the city spread south of the city from the coast to the forest.

## The Port
### Sky Port
The sky port is comprised of four massive stone docks that jut out from the cliffs overlooking the city to the east. The Sky Port is seldom used and is very heavily guarded.

### Alimus Port
The main port of Alimus, typically full of medium to large sized vessels. Used by merchants, large scale fishing operations, visitors, and the military.

### Lower Port
In the lower tier, often used by fishermen, hobbyists, and perhaps unscrupulous sailors with typically small to medium sized vessels.
