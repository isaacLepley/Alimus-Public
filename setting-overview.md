# Setting Overview


I have more notes about stuff, and a full detailed overview of the city is in progress, but I’m not quite to the point of putting it all out there yet. Please reach out with any questions or specific ideas you have. Thanks!

[Player brainstorming document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gD8qbw5iMtRr_h-BPNG875Gul1bemXggJr7kiFw9V58/edit?tab=t.0). Please feel free to hop in there and record any ideas you have about the city in general.

# Intersecting the Truths

## Cosmos and Location

Alimus is a unique location not only in the world, but in the multiverse. The crystals atop Mount Fyr and their interaction with various phenomena make Alimus a place of particular interest for pilgrims and scholars. Visitors from other continents, planes, and even Wildspace add to the diversity and intrigue of Alimus.

## Cosmos and Organization

Alimus’s government - most especially the constables - constantly work with invested parties to ensure celebrations throughout the city are safe, logistically sound, and follow regulations.

## Cosmos and Religion

Temples to every god throughout Alimus have claimed various astronomical phenomena as signs and festivals for their god. The grand temple of Selune has two massive physical models of the stars and planets set into the temple floor, and these set the standard for the astrological calendar in the city.

## Cosmos and the Crystals

When astrological phenomena occur (like a meteor shower lighting up the sky, or an alignment of celestial bodies), the crystals will typically shimmer or glow as the crystals purportedly amplify the energies of the cosmos. This astrological energy manifests as phenomena throughout the city, e.g. glowing lights floating above the ground, particular creatures like a bird species swarming the city, or flowers suddenly blooming in every livable nook and cranny.

## Location and Organization

Alimus is a tiered city. The various tiers are physically separated from each other by walls and gradually ascend up the foothills toward Mount Fyr. From the farming hamlets on the plains to the grand estates in Upper Echelon, Alimus is generally wealthier and safer the higher in the city you are.

## Location and Religion

Every religion with a temple in Alimus has a rich history tied to the land. Every religion has stories of how their god was influential in particular advancements, wars, and events throughout the known history of the city. Like the crystals, there is record of religion in Alimus since ancient, prehistoric times.

## Location and the Crystals

The crystals seem to provide protection from extreme weather, so the area around Alimus is very fruitful and desirable to settle. 

## Organization and Religion

Religion is interwoven with the organization of Alimus. The six seats on the city government represent a faithful body that oversees an important aspect of running the city. Priestly mandates from those religions are effectively law, and many petitioners have a hard time arguing for change in the city when their viewpoint doesn’t align with that of a powerful church.

## Organization and the Crystals

The crystals are overseen by an ancient monastery that reveres the crystals and their unique energies. This monastery is outside the city, but these reclusive monks are well respected, and it is not uncommon for the city government to consult the monks on various matters.

## Religion and the Crystals

As religion in Alimus is deeply tied to the land, every group has old stories about the connection between their god and the iconic crystals atop Mount Fyr. Many religions highly revere these crystals and view them as a connection between the material world and the divine. However, some religions disdain the crystals. 

For example, faithful to Umberlee or Typhon may sneer at the crystals and their effect on the weather, since tumultuous, stormy seas represent their god’s will in the world. To their displeasure, the crystals’ calming effect on weather makes rough waves and coastal storms never affect Alimus and the sailors in its port.

# Locations in the City

## Upper District

### Upper Echelon

Upper Echelon is where the wealthiest citizens of Alimus reside - and is where the high government presides. It sits behind the highest walls and has many gated sections within. The only truly open part of Upper Echelon is the temple square, where massive cathedrals to the most powerful gods look over the city below.

## Middle Districts

### Alimus Proper

The largest and central district of Alimus, situated between Main Port and the Woods. Visitors by land often enter the city through the main gate, which cuts between the lesser districts of Low Town and Cold Town and leads into Alimus Proper. This district is exceptionally diverse and could be a small city itself - full of homes, markets, temples, taverns, and just about anything else.

### The Woods

The woods is a beautiful district situated on the foothills neighboring the vast Desmaden forest. An airy and vibrant district, it is where many of Alimus’s woodsy creatures call home. Here is where you will find the temples to gods of nature and wilderness, religions followed by a large number of faithful, even in a large city like Alimus.

## Lower Districts

### Cold Town

Cold Town is a chilly part of Alimus where it is always cold and there are always snowflakes falling from the sky, even on a clear day.

### Farming Hamlets

Small settlements outside the city walls still enjoy the calm weather of Alimus. Various farms that support the city spread south of the city from the coast to the forest.

### Low Town

Situated between the Lower Port and the main city gates, low town is slummy, crummy, and often dangerous. The constables avoid Low Town, and it is full of all sorts of characters, the only common trait among them perhaps being that they are resilient, if nothing else.

## Places of Interest

### Tonttu Academy

Founded by gnomes and situated high up in the city, the Academy is where great minds are forged. Tonttu Academy boasts an extremely extensive catalogue of degree options, and is the premier place for young minds to hone their craft. But learning is not for everyone. The main obstacle between many dreamers and their heart’s desire is an official acceptance to get into the Academy.

### Desmaden Forest

To the east of Alimus lies a vast forested region. Much of it is tamed and supplies the city with lumber and game, but deep in the woods lurks the mystery and danger of untamed wilderness.

### Kabo Mine

Ran by goblin moguls, the vast mines beneath Mount Fyr are excavated tirelessly by hardy workers to keep Alimus supplied with raw minerals.

### Kristalliturna Monastery

Reclusive monks revere the crystals above Alimus, training to hone their energies in tune with that of the mountain. Few pilgrims take the mountain journey to the monastery, but the monks are revered and are sometimes called upon by leaders or scholars to share their wisdom in the city.

### Astrouheem Observatory

While the city itself is full of various observatories, especially atop high buildings, one large observatory exists outside the city well up the mountainside. Here the most acclaimed and dedicated seers pursue the perfection of astronomy and further knowledge of the cosmos.

### The Port

Kind of a district in itself, the Port spans almost the entire western side of Alimus, following the gentle coast up to the steep cliffs closer toward Mount Fyr. There are three distinct ports in Alimus, though each share the same sea:

- Sky Port: Four massive stone docks extend from the cliffs and are used by visitors from wildspace or even other planes - these visitors often have business at a large temple.
    
- Main Port: Often the most crowded part of Alimus. Commerce ran through the port is vital to life in Alimus, and the constables do their best to ensure the port runs smoothly and safely while keeping the docks filled to the brim with vessels.
    
- Lower Port: Full of ramshackle docks outside the jurisdiction of the constables. Lower port is where lowly fishers and small-time operators begin and end their days.
    

### The Undergrowth

The undergrowth is a sprawling network of loosely connected caverns underneath the city. Here you may find that some of the most beautiful natural parts of the city are actually underground, where enterprising nature lovers can cultivate beautiful groves and grottos away from the bustle and contamination of the city

### The Underwater “District”

*I don’t have much thoughts on this, but it was brought up by Nina and think it would be cool to have a place outside Alimus in the bay where underwater dwellers reside.

  

# Alimus’s Government

The highest authority in Alimus is a council of six representatives of faiths related to important aspects of running the city. Their decisions are law. On occasions where the council is split, a representative from the regional government will cast a deciding vote.

Deities represented in the six council seats:

1. Bahamut, lord of dragons
    
2. Bane, god of order
    
3. Sylvanus, god of nature
    
4. Tyr, god of justice
    
5. Waukeen, goddess of commerce
    
6. The Will of Ioun
    

## The Will of Ioun

Ioun is a lost deity, whose fate happened long ago, and what exactly happened is up for debate. This seat is ran by a rotating cast of folks who are in their own council - the deities under Ioun fall under the broad category of innovation.

Innovation deities:

1. Azuth, god of wizards
    
2. Chauntea, goddess of agriculture
    
3. Deneir, god of writing
    
4. Gond, god of craft
    
5. Oghma, god of knowledge
