# House Rules

## System: D&D Fifth Edition (2024)

- No 2014 classes. Subclasses may be permitted on a case basis. Homebrew subclasses can be worked out as well.
- The broken spells are banned (conjure minor elementals? And the one that’s like running the enemies through a blender)
- Bastions - new 2024 rules for customizable base(s) of operation. I think it would be really sweet if the party got access to Bastions throughout the city. Perhaps everyone in the party could have their own Bastion with things like a workshop and library, an attached tavern, etc.

## Frightened

The following condition rules will be used **instead** of the fifth edition frightened condition.

> **Frightened**.
>  
>  - A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls.
>
>  - A frightened creature cannot roll hero dice.

The **frightened** condition is intricately tied to the [fear and sanity](https://isaaclepley.github.io/Alimus-Public/fear-and-sanity.html) rules that will be used in this game. Players should not expect to find ways to avoid fear entirely in this campaign, and any features a character gets that would allow them to never fear will be modified to give that character a different boon that is more fitting for the campaign.

## Insanity
Insanity is a new condition that will appear in this game. It can occur to creatures whose minds have broken from their stress, as they have seen and experienced more horror than their mind was built to handle. A creature who is insane suffers the following effects: 

> **Insane**.
>  - The insane creature cannot speak. Their mind broken, they can only communicate nonsensical manners, whether that be bubbles and noises, gestures, sprawling's or something else.
>  - *Further effects of insanity will be revealed throughout the course of the game.*

The **insanity** condition is intricately tied to the [fear and sanity](https://isaaclepley.github.io/Alimus-Public/fear-and-sanity.html) rules that will be used in this game.
## Character Creation

- Everyone uses the same ability score rules. Options include standard array, point buy, or roll.
	- If rolled, everyone will roll once and those numbers will be the standard array for the party.

## Inspiration

At the end of each session, two Inspirations will be awarded:
- To the player who shone in role play.
- To the player most nominated by other party members.
## Starting equipment

- Standard rules plus flavor/blursed items
- One common and one uncommon magic item.
- They serve the purpose of adding flavor and depth to your character, and at least one should come with story implications.
- i.e. a blessed sword that you are trying to return to its original owner as thanks for something. Or a cloak that helps you hide, but in social situations likes to start banter with others and poke fun at you.

## Free flavor feat
- Flavor feats generally don't have combat utility. Please ask me if you are unsure what constitutes a flavor feat.
- These will probably be awarded at level 1.

## I know a guy!

- Usable once per session for the whole party. Allows players to improvise an NPC who can show up/be found and help in a situation. An appropriate skill check will inform how helpful/friendly the NPC starts off.

## Players describe their spells and abilities (flavor is free)

- I will try to remember to call for this whenever players use a spell or ability for the first time, after that players may describe their abilities when they think it's fitting

## Healing Potions

- May be drank as a bonus action (standard rules)
- Drinking as an action will restore the maximum health

## Death saves are made in secret 
- Builds tension. Also allows for medicine checks to actually be useful for something.

## Skills as used in an urban setting:

-  (need to figure out a charisma skill for like knowing people, e.g. Carousing from Traveller)

## Short Rests are shorter

- Idk how much shorter (30 or 15 minutes? Or even instantaneous, like BG3?), but D&D is designed for parties to take more short Rests than ever really happens, so I want to shorten them

## Things to expect to see in this game:

- The Fey Realm
- The Shadowfell
- Worship of Forgotten Realms Deities

## Things to not expect to see in this game:

- Wish
- Deck of Many Things
- The elemental planes/elemental chaos
- The outer planes
- The Seelie and Unseelie courts
