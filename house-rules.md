# House Rules

## System: D&D Fifth Edition (2024)

- No 2014 classes. Subclasses may be permitted on a case basis. Homebrew subclasses can be worked out as well.
- The broken spells are banned (conjure minor elementals? And the one thatâ€™s like running the enemies through a blender)
- Bastions - new 2024 rules for customizable base(s) of operation. I think it would be really sweet if the party got access to Bastions throughout the city. Perhaps everyone in the party could have their own Bastion with things like a workshop and library, an attached tavern, etc.

## Frightened

The following condition rules will be used **instead** of the fifth edition frightened condition.

> **Frightened**.
>  
>  - A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls.
>
>  - A frightened creature cannot roll hero dice.

The **frightened** condition is intricately tied to the [fear and sanity](https://isaaclepley.github.io/Alimus-Public/fear-and-sanity.html) rules that will be used in this game. Players should not expect to find ways to avoid fear entirely in this campaign, and any features a character gets that would allow them to never fear will be modified to give that character a different boon that is more fitting for the campaign.

## Insanity
Insanity is a new condition that will appear in this game. It can occur to creatures whose minds have broken from their stress, as they have seen and experienced more horror than their mind was built to handle. A creature who is insane suffers the following effects: 

> **Insane**.
>  - The insane creature cannot speak. Their mind broken, they can only communicate nonsensical manners, whether that be bubbles and noises, gestures, sprawling's or something else.
>  - *Further effects of insanity will be revealed throughout the course of the game.*

The **insanity** condition is intricately tied to the [fear and sanity](https://isaaclepley.github.io/Alimus-Public/fear-and-sanity.html) rules that will be used in this game. The vast majority of characters in Alimus do not know how to cure insanity, but thankfully, it is a rare condition. It is known that the Alimus Asylum has cured patients after intensive care, and those cured have been sent back out into society to continue living normal lives.

## Character Creation

- Everyone uses the same ability score rules. Options include standard array, point buy, or roll.
- If rolled, everyone will roll once and those numbers will be the standard array for the party.

## Inspiration

At the end of each session, two Inspirations will be awarded:
- To the player who shone in role play.
- To the player most nominated by other party members.

## Starting equipment

- Standard rules plus flavor/blursed items
- One common and one uncommon magic item.
- They serve the purpose of adding flavor and depth to your character, and at least one should come with story implications.
- i.e. a blessed sword that you are trying to return to its original owner as thanks for something. Or a cloak that helps you hide, but in social situations likes to start banter with others and poke fun at you.

## Downtime

As cosmological events and the calendar are very important in Alimus, downtime between notable events or exploits will be common. Villainous machinations typically unfold over the course of months and years, if not decades - not just over days and weeks. And our party's growth from level 1 to 20 in this campaign should feel organic, natural, and earned - not sudden and meteroic. The time between adventures is still very important - while ne'er-do-wells scheme and the stars follow their courses, our party will be training, investigating, researching and more.
Uses of downtime:


## Free flavor feat
- Flavor feats generally don't have combat utility. Please ask me if you are unsure what constitutes a flavor feat.
- These may be learned by studying a craft during downtime.

## I know a guy!

- Usable once per session for the whole party. Allows players to improvise an NPC who can show up/be found and help in a situation. An appropriate skill check will inform how helpful/friendly the NPC starts off.

## Players describe their spells and abilities (flavor is free)

- I will try to remember to call for this whenever players use a spell or ability for the first time, after that players may describe their abilities when they think it's fitting

## Healing Potions

- May be drank as a bonus action (standard rules)
- Drinking as an action will restore the maximum health

## Death saves are made in secret 
- Builds tension. Also allows for medicine checks to actually be useful for something.

## Skills in an Urban Setting:
The following are examples of how skills could be used specifically in Alimus. Some commonly used or generically good and obvious skills may be omitted from the list. Please consult with your fellow party members and refer to a detailed list of skills like that in the Player Handbook or [online](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#strength) when deciding which skills to prioritize for your character.

## Short Rests are shorter

- Idk how much shorter (30 or 15 minutes? Or even instantaneous, like BG3?), but D&D is designed for parties to take more short Rests than ever really happens, so I want to shorten them

- A very diverse, whimsical cast of NPCs
- The Fey Realm
- The Shadowfell
- The Underdark
- Wildspace/cosmic travellers
- Worship of Forgotten Realms Deities
