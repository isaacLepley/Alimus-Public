# House Rules and Logistical Expectations

## D&D 5e 2024 rules

- No 2014 classes. Subclasses may be permitted on a case basis. Homebrew subclasses can be worked out as well.
- The broken spells are banned (conjure minor elementals? And the one that’s like running the enemies through a blender)
- Bastions - new 2024 rules for customizable base(s) of operation. I think it would be really sweet if the party got access to Bastions throughout the city. Perhaps everyone in the party could have their own Bastion with things like a workshop and library, an attached tavern, etc.

## Character Creation

- Everyone uses the same ability score rules. Options include standard array, point buy, or roll (if rolled, everyone will roll once and those numbers will be the standard array)

## Starting equipment

- Standard rules plus flavor/blursed items
- One common and one uncommon magic item.
- They serve the purpose of adding flavor and depth to your character, and at least one should come with story implications.
- i.e. a blessed sword that you are trying to return to its original owner as thanks for something. Or a cloak that helps you hide, but in social situations likes to start banter with others and poke fun at you.

## Free flavor feat (on level 2?)

## I know a guy!

- Usable once per session for the whole party. Allows players to improvise an NPC who can show up/be found and help in a situation. An appropriate skill check will inform how helpful/friendly the NPC starts off.

## Players describe their spells and abilities (flavor is free)

- I will try to remember to call for this whenever players use a spell or ability for the first time, after that players may describe their abilities when they think it's fitting

## Healing Potions

- May be drank as a bonus action (standard rules)
- Drinking as an action will restore the maximum health

## Death saves are made in secret (not 100% convinced on this one, idk)

## Skills as used in an urban setting:

-  (need to figure out a charisma skill for like knowing people, e.g. Carousing from Traveller)

Short Rests are shorter

- Idk how much shorter (30 or 15 minutes? Or even instantaneous, like BG3?), but d&d is designed for parties to take more short Rests than ever really happens, so I want to shorten them

Things to not expect to see in this game:

- Wish
- Deck of Many Things
