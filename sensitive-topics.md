## Mental Illness 

Insanity, trauma, and stress are all sensitive topics that are deeply tied to fantasy horror. As such, this game will feature these topics, as ailments that may afflict the player characters or NPCs. 
Each player agrees to be exposed to these topics and to roleplay characters that exhibit signs of stress and may experience mental trauma. 

As mental illness is a very real topic, players are encouraged to discuss with the game master beforehand any concerns they may have about the portrayal of mental illness. At any point during gameplay or between sessions, players have the right to pause the game and request for certain things to not be described or broached as a topic in the game. 

## Romance and Sex 

Romance between game characters can be very rewarding part of roleplaying. Romance between different game characters can be described by one player, or it may be between characters controlled by multiple players at the table. Regardless, there is a line for what is acceptable to describe at the game table and it is within the realm of PG and PG-13 material. Scenes where continuing player descriptions may cross the PG-13 line will respectfully fade to black. 

## Substance Abuse and Addiction

Drugs and alcohol will be a part of the game, and there may be characters that suffer with substance abuse or addiction. Addiction is an obstacle that characters in this game can work to overcome. Depictions of it should be respectful and not make light of the issue. Substance abuse should not be romanticized or described in excess or gratuitous detail.

## Gore

A combat-heavy system like Dungeons & Dragons does not work without some violence. Characters in this game will suffer, hurt, and die. However, gratuitous depictions of violence are unnecessary and unwelcome at the table. A rule of thumb for this is that multiple-sentence descriptions of the results of an attack or harmful effects to a creature's body are unnecessary. 

This campaign will include some body horror elements, for example, walking stitched corpses or abominable horrors bursting from inside someone. These topics will be handled with respect, and descriptions should not include excessive detail, as described above.

# Taboo Topics 

The following topics are issues that will not be portrayed in the game. All players promise to avoid these topics, as even the fictional representation of them could cause uncomfortable situations for those playing. The D&D table is a place for safe role-playing where players should not experience any real-life fear or hurt. 

## Slavery 

In this fictional game, there will be no slavery. All beings in this fictional game respect a universal rule that no intelligent being should own or be owned by another intelligent being. 

Similar topics that may appear in the game include unfair compensation, exploitation, and endangerment. These types of evil, whether portrayed as accidental or intentional, are sufficient to portray unfairness that the player characters can overcome without bringing slavery into the game.

## Sexual Assault 

Portraying sexual conduct or behavior that occurs without explicit consent of the victim in roleplay requires the consent of all the players at the table. Sexual assault is not necessary in a game of Dungeon and Dragons, and it will not appear in this campaign.

## Domestic Abuse 

So as to not stress any players of this game, characters in this fictional world all hold a basic level of respect for others. This game will not include depictions of domestic abuse - committed by family or those who are trusted and respected in their position of authority abusing their relationships. Similar topics that may appear in the game include betrayal, theft, fraud, and abuse of power.
