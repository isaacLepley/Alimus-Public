## Places of Interest

### Tonttu Academy

Founded by gnomes and situated high up in the city, the Academy is where great minds are forged. Tonttu Academy boasts an extremely extensive catalogue of degree options, and is the premier place for young minds to hone their craft. But learning is not for everyone. The main obstacle between many dreamers and their heart’s desire is an official acceptance to get into the Academy.

### Desmaden Forest

To the east of Alimus lies a vast forested region. Much of it is tamed and supplies the city with lumber and game, but deep in the woods lurks the mystery and danger of untamed wilderness.

### Kabo Mine

Ran by goblin moguls, the vast mines beneath Mount Fyr are excavated tirelessly by hardy workers to keep Alimus supplied with raw minerals.

### Kristalliturna Monastery

Reclusive monks revere the crystals above Alimus, training to hone their energies in tune with that of the mountain. Few pilgrims take the mountain journey to the monastery, but the monks are revered and are sometimes called upon by leaders or scholars to share their wisdom in the city.

### Astrouheem Observatory

While the city itself is full of various observatories, especially atop high buildings, one large observatory exists outside the city well up the mountainside. Here the most acclaimed and dedicated seers pursue the perfection of astronomy and further knowledge of the cosmos.

### The Port

Kind of a district in itself, the Port spans almost the entire western side of Alimus, following the gentle coast up to the steep cliffs closer toward Mount Fyr. There are three distinct ports in Alimus, though each share the same sea:

- Sky Port: Four massive stone docks extend from the cliffs and are used by visitors from wildspace or even other planes - these visitors often have business at a large temple.

- Main Port: Often the most crowded part of Alimus. Commerce ran through the port is vital to life in Alimus, and the constables do their best to ensure the port runs smoothly and safely while keeping the docks filled to the brim with vessels.

- Lower Port: Full of ramshackle docks outside the jurisdiction of the constables. Lower port is where lowly fishers and small-time operators begin and end their days.


### The Undergrowth

The undergrowth is a sprawling network of loosely connected caverns underneath the city. Here you may find that some of the most beautiful natural parts of the city are actually underground, where enterprising nature lovers can cultivate beautiful groves and grottos away from the bustle and contamination of the city

### The Underwater “District”

*I don’t have much thoughts on this, but it was brought up by Nina and think it would be cool to have a place outside Alimus in the bay where underwater dwellers reside.
