# Name: Grimble

Class: Artificer

Race: Deep gnome (svirfneblin)

Background: Guild artisan

### Why is he in a hole-in-the-wall tavern in the middle of a Sunday afternoon? 

- Grimble recently made a rash bet that a contraption of his could fly from one rooftop to another across a busy street. Thankfully no one was injured, but now he’s down on his luck. He hopes he can turn things around after winning a drinking game among rabble-rousers at the tavern.

### His Dream:

- Become the head of a project at the Academy, something like creating a new type of golem or pioneering a new type of airship.

### 2 or 3 goals:

- Get into the academy and graduate as an inventor/artificer with high marks
- Find out what really happened when his sister disappeared on a street corner eight years ago, never to be seen again.

### Phobias:

- Creature:
	- **Undead**. He hasn't had many interactions with undead in his life, but stories told to him as a kid haunted his waking thoughts and his nightmares, and he dreads ever coming face to face with one.
- Creature/General:
	- **Sailors**. Grimble has had unfortunate interactions with sailors, always bad it seems. When young, he was overcharged by over ten times for some fish. He was robbed by a sailor once. And a distant relative of his disappeared on a fishing excursion. Thus, he holds a deep fear and concern about sailors.
- Specific:
	- **Clowns**. His uncle was a clown by profession, and Grimble's family always thought he was creepy and untrustworthy. Turns out, his uncle was embezzling funds from the local orphanage and is in jail now. Grimble now trusts no clown.

### Blursed/flavorful magic items:

- Common: Bottle of Endless Coffee

- Grimble’s most prized possession - a present from his grandfather on his 17th birthday, which is an important coming-of-age celebration. His grandfather has been the biggest believers in his dreams and projects.

- Uncommon: Hag Eye

- The one thing Grimble found at the corner where his sister disappeared eight years ago.

### At least 2 connections with other party members:

- TBD
- TBD

### Where he currently resides:

- In a shack on the edge of Low Town, on a block that feels pretty safe. It is very basic, but inexpensive.

### His ideal [bastion](https://dungeonsanddragonsfan.com/dnd-bastion-system/) ([home/base](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1828-exploring-bastions-from-the-2024-dungeon-masters?srsltid=AfmBOopOp7I2BdPh3EE22r94J8JrWt1Dyk7r9HOMHFPJdO2Y2fshiu3P)):

- He would like to own either a coffee shop as a side gig, or a workshop where he and others could tinker. And if his living situation was attached, either above, behind, or below his shop, that would be perfect.

### Favorite place in the city:

- Bronzebeard Smithy, a workshop and forge in Cold Town ran by a fire dwarf and goblin couple. They always let Grimble rifle through their scraps and work on projects in the back of the shop.

### Least favorite place in the city:

- The Crypt of Laetis, where his mother’s body was interred by decree of the local judge. She is not buried with their ancestors at the old graveyard ran by priests of Kelemvor, and that funeral was one of the hardest times in his life.

### His favorite festival:
- **Perfect Alignment**. Grimble is a huge fan of volunteering to be a guide during the Perfect Alignment. During the alignment, 10,000 Modrons march through Alimus, but their march can be devastating. Thankfully, brave ambassadors long ago discovered that the modrons can be led away from their straight path as long as they are wearing socks. So each alignment, which happens every 642 days, volunteers outside the city provide socks to the modrons and guide them around the city , so as to avoid any unnecessary confrontations.

### His least favorite festival:
- **Super Moon**. This happens when the larger moon, the moon of Selune, is closest to Alimus. The bright moon makes for fun evenings, and is a night associated by many with romance. Unfortunately for Grimble, he has scheduled a date with a new crush on each of the past three Super Moons. And none of those dates went even remotely well.

### A friend/ally:

- Grimble has made good friends with a blink dog named Treats that lives somewhere below his family’s home in an underground natural cavern, part of the wild underground region of Alimus known as the Undergrowth.

### A rival/enemy:

- His older cousin, who is not a deep gnome and is in her final year at the Academy. She has always looked down on Grimble and clashed with him at family events.

### A god he likes/reveres

- Gond, god of craft. Grimble’s mother always stitched Gond’s symbols on the inside of his clothes as a blessing, which is a task now taken up by his grandmother since his mom’s passing.

### A god he disdains/fears

- Grimble does not trust the followers of Bane, those tasked with keeping order in the city. He just doesn’t understand why the judge wouldn’t let them bury her mother in the old graveyard, and thinks the constables have utterly failed keeping the order in the dangerous Low Town district.
