Example of what I expect from everyone who builds a character for Alimus

# Name: Grimble

Class: Artificer

Race: Deep gnome (svirfneblin)

Background: TBD

### His Dream:

- Become the head of a project at the Academy, something like creating a new type of golem or pioneering a new type of airship.

### 2 or 3 goals:

- Get into the academy and graduate as an inventor/artificer with high marks
- Find out what really happened when his sister disappeared on a street corner eight years ago, never to be seen again.

### At least 2 connections with other party members:

- TBD
- TBD

### Favorite place in the city:

- Bronzebeard Smithy, a workshop and forge in Cold Town ran by a fire dwarf and goblin couple. They always let Grimble rifle through their scraps and work on projects in the back of the shop.

### Least favorite place in the city:

- The Crypt of Laetis, where his mother’s body was interred by decree of the local judge. She is not buried with their ancestors at the old graveyard ran by priests of Kelemvor, and that funeral was one of the hardest times in his life.

### A friend/ally

- Grimble has made good friends with a blink dog named Treats that lives somewhere below his family’s home in an underground natural cavern, part of the wild underground region of Alimus known as the Undergrowth.

### A rival/enemy

- His older cousin, who is not a deep gnome and is in her final year at the Academy. She has always looked down on Grimble and clashed with him at family events.

### A god he likes/reveres

- Gond, god of craft. Grimble’s mother always stitched Gond’s symbols on the inside of his clothes as a blessing, which is a task now taken up by his grandmother since his mom’s passing.

### A god he disdains/fears

- Grimble does not trust the followers of Bane, those tasked with keeping order in the city. He just doesn’t understand why the judge wouldn’t let them bury her mother in the old graveyard, and thinks the constables have utterly failed keeping the order in the dangerous Low Town district.

### Blursed/flavorful items:

- Common: Bottle of Endless Coffee

- Grimble’s most prized possession - a present from his grandfather on his 17th birthday, which is an important coming-of-age celebration. His grandfather has been the biggest believers in his dreams and projects.

- Uncommon: Hag Eye

- The one thing Grimble found at the street corner where his sister disappeared eight years ago.
