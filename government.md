# Alimusâ€™s Government

The highest authority in Alimus is a council of six representatives of faiths related to important aspects of running the city. Their decisions are law. On occasions where the council is split, a representative from the regional government will cast a deciding vote.

Deities represented in the six council seats:

1. Bahamut, lord of dragons
    
2. Bane, god of order
    
3. Sylvanus, god of nature
    
4. Tyr, god of justice
    
5. Waukeen, goddess of commerce
    
6. The Will of Ioun
    

## The Will of Ioun

Ioun is a lost deity, whose fate happened long ago, and what exactly happened is up for debate. This seat is ran by a rotating cast of folks who are in their own council - the deities under Ioun fall under the broad category of innovation.

Innovation deities:

1. Azuth, god of wizards
    
2. Chauntea, goddess of agriculture
    
3. Deneir, god of writing
    
4. Gond, god of craft
    
5. Oghma, god of knowledge
